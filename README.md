LAN8720 board for MangoPi MQ-Pro
================================

In the first iteration I tested the experimental patch based on `arch/riscv/boot/dts/allwinner/sun20i-d1-nezha.dts` rather than `arch/riscv/boot/dts/allwinner/sun20i-d1-mangopi-mq-pro.dts` with bread-board version of the schematic.

The patch and the table of connections is added. It will be moved to the legacy secion once I have the v1 schematics, board and final DT.

TBD: This will be open source/OpenHW for sure.
